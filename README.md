# Amazon-Sales-Data-Dashboard-using-PowerBI

Objective:
The objective of this project was to analyze and visualize Amazon's sales data to uncover key insights and trends that can inform business decisions. The dataset used for this project was sourced from Kaggle and included various columns such as region, country, item type, sales channel, order priority, order date, order ID, ship date, units sold, unit price, unit cost, total revenue, total cost, and total profit.

Dashboard Components:

1. Sales Overview:
   - Total Sales and Total Orders: This section provides a high-level summary of Amazon's overall sales performance, showing the total revenue generated and the number of orders processed. These metrics are crucial for understanding the scale of operations and the overall sales volume.

2. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):
   - Average Order Value (AOV), Average Profit per Order, Cost per Unit, and Revenue per Unit: KPIs were included to assess the financial health of the sales operations. AOV gives an idea of the average spend per customer, while Average Profit per Order highlights profitability. Cost per Unit and Revenue per Unit provide insights into pricing strategies and cost management.

3. Revenue and Profit Analysis:
   - Total Profit and Profit Margin: These metrics are essential for evaluating the profitability of the business. By comparing revenue with costs, I was able to assess how efficiently the business is converting sales into profit. Profit Margin is particularly important as it indicates the percentage of revenue that translates into profit.

4. Sales by Region and Country:
   - This analysis provides a geographical breakdown of sales performance, highlighting which regions and countries are contributing most to the revenue. Understanding geographical trends helps in targeting marketing efforts and optimizing supply chain logistics.

5. Product Analysis:
   - Top Selling Items and Revenue by Item Type: By analyzing the sales performance of different product categories and individual items, I identified the best-selling products. This insight is valuable for inventory management, marketing strategies, and identifying potential growth areas.

6. *Sales Channel and Order Priority Analysis:*
   - The analysis of sales by channel (e.g., online, retail) and order priority (e.g., high, medium, low) provides insights into customer preferences and operational efficiency. This helps in optimizing sales strategies across different channels and prioritizing orders based on profitability.

7. Time Analysis:
   - The temporal analysis of sales and orders over time allowed for the identification of trends, seasonality, and peak sales periods. This information is crucial for demand forecasting, inventory planning, and marketing campaigns.

8. Interactive Filters:
   - Date, Region, Country, Item Type, and Sales Channel filters were added to enable dynamic exploration of the data. These filters empower users to drill down into specific segments of the data, allowing for a more tailored analysis based on different criteria.

Reasoning for the Project:

This project was undertaken to develop a comprehensive understanding of Amazon's sales performance across multiple dimensions, including geography, product types, sales channels, and time. The use of Power BI allowed for the creation of an interactive and visually appealing dashboard that can be used by stakeholders to make informed business decisions.

By breaking down the data into easily digestible visuals and metrics, the dashboard provides valuable insights into where the business is thriving and where there are opportunities for improvement. The interactive nature of the dashboard enables users to explore the data in real-time, allowing for more agile and data-driven decision-making processes.

Overall, this project not only showcases my technical skills in Power BI but also demonstrates my ability to interpret data, identify key business insights, and present them in a manner that is both informative and actionable.
